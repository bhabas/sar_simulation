"Evolved" Paper so can reuse work from conference paper
Page length: 12-20 pages

NOTE:
The earlier conference version(s) must be cited in this statement. 
This statement is preferably a single, standalone paragraph near the end of the first section, 
so it is obvious what is being claimed as new. In addition, the earlier conference version(s) 
must be cited in the submission's cover letter and must be uploaded along with the journal submission

Introduction
- Dynamic perching onto ceiling surface is hard
- Implementation should be computationally efficient
- Under actuation creates difficulty
- Related work (External sensing dependent)
- Onboard sensory values are sufficient
- Short covering of Tau-theory (Shift away from RREV)
- EPHE use to estimate parameters


Methodology
- Overall process
    - Large array of velocities and angles
    - Use EPHE to find (Tau,My) combination
    - Record flip triggering (Tau,OFy,d_ceil) and resulting My_d
        - My_d is not directly true since rear motors give counter moment that decreases with time
        - Part of environment
        - Learning in motor control space
    - Approximate values with two Neural Networks
    - Implement NNs to controller
    - Validate with Sim and implement in Experiment

- Geometric tracking controller
- System identification
    - Inertia validation
        - Include values with stock battery?
    - Battery compensation curve (upgraded motors)
        - Include values for stock motors? (Good for community)
    - Motor Speed-up/slow-down time constants

- Landing gear design
    - Dimensional aspects
    - Velcro tip with rotational joint

- EPHE algorithm
    - More math notational explanation
    - Reward function

- NN flip/policy implementation
    - Linear feed forward network
    - One network for classification
        - Can change threshold to change robustness 
    - One network for policy value
        - Easier to optimize two seperate networks than one combined
        - Easier computationally as well (continually check one network and run other when flip triggered)
    - Based on landing success rate
    - Learned values are exact and discrete but need continuous function
        - Impossible to meet exact conditions learned in simulation during experimental trials (2-D flight)

- Sim-to-Real transfer
    - System identification
    - Domain randomization
        - Compare raw w/ DR

- Experimental setup
    - Used constant velocity trajectory generation to get quadrotor up to speed
    - Crazyflie used
    - Communication method
        - ROS
        - CRTP


- Results and Discussion
    - More detailed dicussion advantages of landing gear designs
    - Slow motion video of 2-D landing

    - Show same landing gear plots
    - Quantify success of NN behavior in some way
    - Narrow-Long design used because of overall great performance

    - Approach can be generalized to other surfaces
