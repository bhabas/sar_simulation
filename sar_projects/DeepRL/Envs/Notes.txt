Misc:
- What would non-dimensionalizing velocity look like? It'd be body length but FR length or L_eff length?


0_Deg Landing Plane
- At low vel, system needs sufficient Z vel to allow for rotation of legs to ceiling. 
    Gravity pulls model down and if insufficient Z vel, it will fall and distance itself from ceiling as rotating
    

- At high vertical velocity, rigid models suffer from momentum pushing them into the ceiling.   
    Flexible legs will absorb this momentum as well as close leg angle and lead to success
